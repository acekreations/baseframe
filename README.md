## Long Term / Roadmap

The long term goal of Baseframe is to turn all CSS properties into a library that will minimize the need to write CSS, improving development time and reducing CSS clutter.

Currently I am working to build out the most commonly used CSS properties with as many options as possible included. The next step is building out the remaining CSS classes again with as many options as possible. Possible future goals may include building a grid system and the addition of styling templates or additional styling options on classes. If you have other ideas please see above.
